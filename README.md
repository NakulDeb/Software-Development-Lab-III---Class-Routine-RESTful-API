Meetie  is a chatting app which uses  Google Firebases realtime Database for storing the data.The conversation between people is encrypted in the database.Again the users can get notifications with a sound when they get a new message. 

The Register/Login sections are providing a good UX.User can Register only with an email ID and a password.This is  as easy as login into the e-mail.Login in the chatting app is also so easy.After registering just using the email-ID and the password anyone can login.

Finding a friend in our app is so easy!you just need to  write his/her email-ID in the search box.If the email-ID is registered in our system you can find her/him easily.

You can have a group chat with your friends just adding them into a group from our group chatting layer.
